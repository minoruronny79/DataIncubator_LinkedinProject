# DataIncubator_LinkedinProject

# Graphs
Those graphs are just the initial exploratory analysis for a natural language processing proposal project

Graph1: It is a trend line of top 10 companies with more followers

Graph2: Wordcloud of a sample from the column "description" in the linkedin database



# Summary Project
The idea of this project is to find a relationship between keywords by industry and how they are related to the increase or decrease of specific posting jobs such as data science and analytics. To accomplish this project, I would like to analyze the Linkedin data source and possibly combine with other data sources. While it is well known the increase of data related jobs in the last years, it would be useful for companies and data related professionals to have a hint of new niches where one could explode data science beyond traditional posting jobs. For example, there is a higher proportion of the word “social responsibility” for a specific region and  for a specific industry (let’s suppose finance). Therefore, while it would be logical that a finance company will be looking for data science-finance related jobs, it could be an opportunity for the company to explore as data science project the new areas mentioned recurrently for its industry in its region. At the same time, it could be useful for a professional to have a hint of the tendency for an industry beyond the core business.
To accomplish this project, it will be important to analyze:
1)	The dynamic (quarterly, yearly) of employees by company and industry (decreasing, non-decreasing). For example in linkedin dataset analyze followers count and employees on platform.
2)	1st analysis of unstructured data. For example in linkedin dataset analyze description of the company.
3)	Create a lexicon of management words (after analyzing word frequencies, word clouds, etc). For example: “flexible”, “social responsibility”,  “leadership”, “community”, etc.  
4)	Apply unsupervised learning methods such as clusters.
5)	Apply a supervised learning to analyze relationships. Growth in job posting in finance and social responsibility are related? 

In my preliminary analysis, I’ve just created some plots about the growth by industry and created a word cloud from a sample. The idea is to explore much deeper analyzing by industry and location and fundamentally its possible relationships.
